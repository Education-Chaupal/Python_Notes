result = 7
a = 6
result 13
0
13


z = int(input())

while a!=0:
  a = z
  a = a + 2
  print(a)
  if z != 0:
    z = int(input())
  else:
    break


sum = 0
num = int(input("Enter a number : "))

while num != 0:
    sum += num
    num = int(input("Enter a number : "))

print("The sum of the numbers is:", sum)
