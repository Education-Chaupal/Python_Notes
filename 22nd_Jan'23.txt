step 1.take a input as a number
step 2: the number is in between 1500 se 2700:
		if number is divisible by 5 and number is divisible by 7:
			print that number

12 = int
'12'=string

jab kabhi bhi humlog input lenge type string

print("no of days applied is:",12)
print("no of days applied is:",6)
print("no leave applied")
print("no of days applied is:",1)
print("no of days applied is:",0)





input = paternity leave


write a python program to find those number which are divisble by 7 and multiple by 5,between 1500 and 2700(both included)



x>= 1500 and   x <=2700


		and

0 0		0

0 1		0

1 0		0

1 1		1
